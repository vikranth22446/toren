# Claude Agent Runner

## Project Overview
The **Claude Agent Runner** (`claude_agent_runner`) is a production-grade autonomous GitHub agent system that processes specifications, executes code changes, and creates pull requests with comprehensive security controls.

## System Evolution & Security

### Development Journey:
1. **Started** with planning a minimal Claude agent for processing GitHub issues
2. **Evolved** to support Docker-based execution with base image inheritance  
3. **Unified** CLI interface with comprehensive dashboard functionality
4. **Implemented** enterprise-grade security with defense-in-depth architecture
5. **Added** comprehensive input validation, secure credential handling, and race condition prevention
6. **Enhanced** with ML/AI environment support (CUDA, custom volumes, environment variables)
7. **Integrated** automated security scanning (Docker vulnerability scanning, git diff analysis)
8. **Organized** utility scripts and comprehensive security documentation

### Security Architecture:
- **Input Sanitization**: Multi-layered validation with regex patterns and allowlists
- **Command Injection Prevention**: All subprocess calls use secure list-based execution
- **Secure Credential Management**: API keys mounted as read-only files vs environment variables
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Strict directory allowlisting with path resolution
- **Race Condition Prevention**: File locking for atomic operations and Docker builds
- **Container Security**: Path validation, resource cleanup, and proper exception handling
- **Automated Security Scanning**: Docker vulnerability scanning with Trivy, git diff-based Python code analysis
- **Security Tools Integration**: Bandit, Safety, Semgrep available in containers with utility scripts

## Usage Patterns

### Direct Execution (Synchronous)
```bash
# Execute task with GitHub issue (synchronous mode)
python3 claude_agent.py run --base-image myproject:dev --issue https://github.com/user/repo/issues/123 --branch fix/issue-123 --disable-daemon

# Execute task with specification file (synchronous mode) 
python3 claude_agent.py run --base-image myproject:dev --spec task.md --branch feature/new-feature --base-branch develop --disable-daemon

# ML/AI workflows with GPU and model caching (background daemon mode by default)
python3 claude_agent.py run --base-image pytorch/pytorch:latest --spec ml_task.md --branch fix/training \
  --env CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 --env HF_HOME=/cache/huggingface \
  --volume /data/models:/workspace/models --volume /cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface
```

### Background Job Management (Default Mode)
```bash
# Start background job (default behavior)
python3 claude_agent.py run --base-image myproject:dev --issue https://github.com/user/repo/issues/123 --branch fix/issue-123

# Monitor job status
python3 claude_agent.py status
python3 claude_agent.py status --job-id abc12345

# Get AI-generated summary
python3 claude_agent.py summary --job-id abc12345

# View container logs  
python3 claude_agent.py logs --job-id abc12345

# Clean up completed jobs
python3 claude_agent.py cleanup

# Kill running job
python3 claude_agent.py kill --job-id abc12345
```

### System Validation
```bash
# Fast health check (default)
python3 claude_agent.py health --docker-image myproject:dev

# Health check with security vulnerability scanning
python3 claude_agent.py health --docker-image myproject:dev --security

# Full health check with AI analysis and security scanning
python3 claude_agent.py health --docker-image myproject:dev --ai --security
```

### Security Scanning
```bash
# Quick git diff security scan (0.5-3 seconds)
./scripts/scan_diff.sh

# Install pre-commit security hooks
./scripts/install-hooks.sh

# Full security analysis
./scripts/run_security_scan.sh

# Docker container vulnerability scanning
./scripts/scan_containers.sh

```

### Within Container (Claude Code)
```bash
# Post progress updates
python /usr/local/bin/github_utils.py notify-progress "Analyzing codebase"

# Update status
python /usr/local/bin/github_utils.py update-status "Processing authentication module"

# Complete task
python /usr/local/bin/github_utils.py notify-completion "Fixed onyx model loading issue"

python /usr/local/bin/github_utils.py notify-error "Missing dependency: pytorch"

# Request clarification
python /usr/local/bin/github_utils.py request-clarification "Should I use JWT or OAuth2 for this endpoint?"

# Security scanning within container
claude-security-scan scan                # Run comprehensive security scan
bandit -r /workspace                     # Manual Python security scan
safety check                            # Check dependency vulnerabilities
```
